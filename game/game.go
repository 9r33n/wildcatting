// Oil and gas wells usually reach their maximum output shortly after completion.
// From that time, other than wells completed in water-drive reservoirs, they decline
// in production, the rapidity of decline depending on the output of the wells and on
// other factors governing their productivity. The production decline curve shows the
// amount of oil and gas produced per unit of time for several consecutive periods;
// if the conditions affecting the rate of production are not changed, the curve may
// be fairly regular, and, if projected, will furnish useful knowledge as to the future
// production of the well. By the aid of this knowledge the value of a property may be
// judged, and proper depletion and depreciation charges may be made on the books of
// the operating company.(Lewis 1918)

	// normal pressure decline. A strong aquifer refers to one in which the water-influx
	// rate approaches the reservoir's fluid withdrawal rate at reservoir conditions.

	//  methods to determine field average reservoir pressure for p/z analysis.
	// Usually, however, individual well pressures are based on extrapolation of
	// pressure buildup tests or from long shut-in periods. In either case, the
	// average pressure measured does not represent a point value, but rather is
	// the average value within the wellâ€™s effective drainage volume
